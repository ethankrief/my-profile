            <h2 class="section-title">My Hobbies !</h2>
            <p>I am passionate about cooking. I love experimenting with recipes, testing new things, and expanding the scope of my possibilities. Obviously, above all, I love the moment of tasting after spending several hours in the kitchen. I am also passionate about adventure. I love discovering new places, new cities, new countries. I am lucky to have already been able to travel a lot during my childhood and I plan to continue discovering the world as soon as possible.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">My Studies üè¢</h2>
            <p>I am currently in my first year of business school at ESSEC Business School, one of the most renowned business schools in France. I study business, accounting, finance, entrepreneurship, mathematics, but also law and economics. I am leaving in September this year for Singapore for a four-month exchange during which I want to discover the region and neighboring countries, while developing my network and knowledge.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">My Further Ambitions</h2>
            <p>At the end of my course, at ESSEC, which takes place over four years. I would like to continue my studies by doing a work-study Master's degree in order to develop other extracurricular skills and gradually integrate myself into the world of work. After completing this Master's degree, I would like to join an investment consulting or wealth management firm, because I think it is a job that is made for me.</p>
            <p>My real objective, behind everything, is to become an entrepreneur, by creating my own company, probably in investment consulting. In fact, I do not want to remain an employee all my life because I have this desire to be an entrepreneur anchored in me. This is probably due to my family, which is made up of a lot of ambitious and assertive entrepreneurs.</p>
